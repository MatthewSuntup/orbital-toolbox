## About
A collection of MATLAB scripts for orbital analysis.

This toolbox is based on code originally developed for a University of Sydney assignment in the [Space Engineering 1 course (2017 Semester 2)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2020/aero/aero2705.html). The code has since been refactored for use in more general cases.

## Credit
Thank you to the University of Sydney for the original task specifications which inspired the creation of this toolbox.

## Disclaimer
This work is entirely my own and has been modified since it was originally implemented for an assignment. It should not be copied in any form by students in university courses with similar assignments. If you are struggling with a similar project and want to get in touch I would be happy to have a chat and help out with your understanding or point you to some useful resources!
